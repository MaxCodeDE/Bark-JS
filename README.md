# Bark JS

 Parse barcode inputs into a unified format.


## What it does

Bark normalises and treats all barcode inputs as the GS1-128 format.

## How to use it

```
npm install bark
```

Bark attempts to figure out which standard the string uses (EAN-8, EAN-13, ITF-14, GS1-128, etc.) and extracts the relevant data. It is accessed by querying Bark for the GS1 Application Identifier's Data Title. For a reference of the Data Titles, see the right-most column here: [GS1 General Specifications Section 3: GS1 Application Identifier Definitions (PDF)](http://www.gs1.se/globalassets/gs1-application-identifiers-in-numerical-order.pdf)

### Examples

Let's pretend we scan [the box in this photo](https://goo.gl/photos/HCE7WrNHDKvQL5ei8).

```javascript
var Bark = require('bark');
var yourInput = '015730033004265615171019';

console.log(Bark.parse( yourInput )); // parse returns the GTIN, or undefined

// Always set after successful parse
console.log(Bark.type); // GS1-128

// These Application Identifiers (AIs) exist in the barcode
console.log(Bark.get('GTIN')); // 57300330042656
console.log(Bark.get('BEST BEFORE')); // 171019

// The SERIAL AI is not set on this barcode
console.log(Bark.get('SERIAL')); // null
```

This means that when you scan a regular barcode รก la EAN-13, only the GTIN is going to be available. Because this is quite common and because sometimes that's all you want, Bark provides a shortcut for it.

An important distinction from `parse()` is that `id()` will return the string itself if identification of the barcode standard failed.

```javascript
var Bark = require('bark');
var yourInput = '015730033004265615171019';

console.log(Bark.id( yourInput )); // 57300330042656

yourInput = 'Foo-And-Oth3r-Bars';
console.log(Bark.id( yourInput )); // Foo-And-Oth3r-Bars
```
